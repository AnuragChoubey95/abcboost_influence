# BoostInLCA - Influence Estimation for GBDTs

BoostInLCA is an innovative algorithm developed using the ABCBoost library (pure C++), enhancing interpretability in Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) by incorporating hierarchical analysis through Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) paths. Detailed documentation and experimental results across various datasets will soon be available.
